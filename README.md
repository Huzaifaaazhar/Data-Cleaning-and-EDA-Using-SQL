# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using SQL

Welcome to the repository dedicated to Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL! In this project, I've leveraged the power of SQL to delve deep into layoffs dataset, ensuring they're pristine and ready for analysis. This repository showcases my approach to cleaning messy data and extracting meaningful insights through comprehensive exploratory analysis techniques.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning Techniques**: Explore how I used SQL queries to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the data is robust and reliable.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Witness firsthand my process of uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships within the data using SQL's analytical capabilities.
  
- **SQL Queries**: Dive into a collection of SQL scripts that demonstrate various data cleaning operations and exploratory analyses performed on diverse datasets.

## Project Structure
- **SQL Scripts**: Contains SQL queries used for cleaning and analyzing datasets. Each script is meticulously annotated to explain its purpose and methodology.
  
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations, methodologies, and insights gained from the EDA process are documented here, providing a clear narrative of the analytical journey.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-cleaning-eda-sql.git`
  
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: `cd data-cleaning-eda-sql`
